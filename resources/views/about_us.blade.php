         <h2 class="section_title">The Regal Dollar Story</h2>
         <div class="left">
			<p>Our story started in the late 70’s by finding exclusive investment opportunity for family offices around the globe from Hong Kong to Brasilia and our selections of investments has been proven for us and other associates in the industry to be the one of the best performing in most categories.</p>

			<p>Through the many years of work, we tried to include small individual investors on the big game but with no break, due to the old system overhead, brokerage fees, and institute handlers will leave no value on any investment returns.
			</p>

			<p>As technology progresses today, we can say goodbye to the old system, we created REGALDOLLARS with the necessity to show small individual investors what they are missing and how the general public can improve their way of life by using a simple, transparent easy to use platform.
			</p>

			<p>When we started our model in the 90’s we had faced a lot of doubters, but we kept moving forward and we stuck to our strategy which was no secret  just stay committed building values in our society and stay small as a boutique investment firm to control our overheads and other unnecessary fees.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="right">
			<p>we met the same kind of doubters when we started REGALDOLLARS on 2017, turns out we are right again. we will keep on moving forward with the same strategy by keep on pushing forward and by being committed to the goal of sharing fare returns to society and staying small.
			</p>

			<p>Perhaps the skeptics they ask now why we do this ‘staying small’? Our answer is Simply we don’t want to become the big Corporates or the giant old institute that we fought since our start two decades ago.</p>

			<p>Now with this platform you can see a whole new opportunity without the restriction of the old system. Providing a simple way to see your near future investment like never been done before; choose directly what suits your needs for the present and near future, no need to wait for decades for your money to maturate. As our client we recruit the future to work for you.
